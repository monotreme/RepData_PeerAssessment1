Activity
========================================================

## Loading and preprocessing the data

The following code reads the data.  Omitting records containing NA, the "aggregate" function is used to calculate the daily steps.

```{r}
activity_raw <- read.csv("activity.csv");
activity <- na.omit(activity_raw);
activity_bydate <- aggregate(activity$steps, by = list(activity$date), sum);
activity_bydate$steps <- as.numeric(activity_bydate$Group.1);
```

A histogram of the number of daily steps is produced from the base plotting function, hist:

```{r fig.width=7, fig.height=6}
hist(activity_bydate$steps, xlab= "Daily Steps", main = "Activity Histogram");
```

The summary data shows the mean number of daily steps to be `r round(mean(activity_bydate$steps),digits=2)`, and median value of daily steps to be `r round(median(activity_bydate$steps), digits=2)`.  This text, however, used an inline calculation to 2 significant digits.

```{r}
summary(activity_bydate);
```
